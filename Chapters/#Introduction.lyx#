Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A multirotor has four rotors is a underactuated mechanical system (UMS).
 It has six degrees of freedom (DOF) to be controlled, but has only four
 motors to exert force and torque on itself.
 Contrast to a fixed-wing aircraft, a multirotor doesn't need a runway to
 take off.
 It's a vertical take-off-and-landing unmanned aerial vehicle which has
 several potential like portability, agility and mobility.
 The advantages of a multirotor have resulted in various applications including
 rescue, agriculture, military attack and cooperative transportation.
 Numerous control related reseaches have studied how to control a multirotor
 robustly, including adaptive control, sliding mode control (SMC), model
 predict control and geometric tracking control which developed on 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)$
\end_inset

, thus avoiding the singularities of Euler angles and it guaranteed stability
 by Lyapunov stability theorem when the initial attitude error is less than
 
\begin_inset Formula $90^{\circ}$

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of seniors in the lab did the research about Parameter Estimation and
 Control of Multirotors Using Integral Concurrent Learning.
 The research estimates mass and moment of inertia of a multirotor, and
 feedbacks the estimation parameter for better flight control.
 The research experiment shows the validity of the theory when the battery
 is fully charged.
 However, when the battery power is geting lower, the estimated mass in
 the experiment is getting bigger .This is because the low power battery
 dosen't have enough power to actuate the motors and other elements on multiroto
r.
 The situation is reasonable because my senior dosen't put the battery power
 model in his reseach.
 As mentioned above, the unmodel hardware does influence to the research,
 and I'm curious that if I could do qualitative and quantitative analysis
 to hardware.
 Eventually, I select motors on a multirotor as my research subject.

Estimate motors efficiency on the multirotor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The present work has developed the UKF model which is able to estimate the
 motors efficiency during multirotor flight, and the estimation method is
 classified into model predictive estimation.
 There are two principal reasons to show this application is important.
 First, the estimation of motors efficiency on the multirotor gives the
 researchers more detailed motors fault information.
 According to the information, the researchers could estimate the flight
 limit of the fault motors multirotor, and replan the flight misson to a
 simple one.
 Second, discovering the level of the motors damage prevents researchers
 from confusing some research problem is contributed by a new algorithm
 or new technique, because there is a chance that the problem is simply
 caused by the defective motors.
 Many researches have developed on the scenario like controlling or detecting
 a multirotor with a broken motor

 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, to estimate the efficiency of all motors on a quadrotor, the author first
 discretizes the linear control system.
 Then, the author designs the states and measurements of the motors efficiency
 observer and proves the stability of the observer.
 Although the estimation of the motors efficiency roughly matches the ground
 truth value, it still has about 15% estimation error.
 In addition, the oberver in

 is linear, which means the research has linearized the highly nonlinear
 system.
 On the other hand, the present work designs the UKF model which is suitable
 for nonlinear system to estimate the motors efficiency.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fault tolerant control (FTC)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prime objective of the FTC is to maintain the controller stability when
 the system undergoes failures such as hardware broken, wind disturbance
 and uncertainty.
 The studies of FTCs have developed for more than 30 years, and there were
 numerous reseachers put their effort into them.
 A FTC is often divided into two categories: passive and active FTCs.
 The passive FTCs are featured in their robust control characteristic.
 A fault in passive FTCs is treated as disturbance or a model uncertainty.
 The stability in those FTCs is maintained by some robust control like sliding
 mode controll (SMC), Hâˆž control and adaptive control.
 On the other hand, the active FTCs include a variety of methods in order
 to conquer the system failures, such as fault detection and diagnosis (FDD),
 control reconfiguration and tajectory replanning.
 With those positive methods, the active FTCs usually defeat the passive
 FTCs on most flight performance in a specific scenario.
 However, active FTCs can only deal with the certain problem, and have little
 tolerance on other failures.
 On this perspective, passive FTCs usually defeat active FTCs.
 The principal control objectives in the present work mostly matches with

 In the research active FTC

, the author adopts a cascaded proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control,
 and define the motor fault variable in control input.
 After the observer detects the motor fault, the FTC provides control reconfigur
ation, and sacrifices heading angle command.
 In contrast, the present work adopts nonlinear control method with stability
 analysis to deal with the highly nonlinear multirotor dynamics, and the
 yaw angle is controlled despite the motors fault.
 In addition to the active FTCs, there are numerous intelligent passive
 FTCs are based on sliding mode control (SMC),

, and they are developed to solve the uncertainties, unmodel variable and
 disturbances.
 The SMCs have high compatibility so that they are capable to be compatible
 with other techniques including adaptive control and backstepping control.
 The aforementioned SMC researches %%[Robust adaptive nonsingular fast terminal
 sliding-mode tracking control for an uncertain quadrotor UAV subjected
 to disturbances] demonstrate the trajectory tracking performance and robustness
 under disturbances via simulation, which ensure the effectiveness of resisting
 disturbances and the flight performance is great.
 Besides, the stability analysis of the SMCs are rigorously proved according
 to the Lyapunov analysis and theory.
 However, they experience the unfavorable problem of oscillations with finite
 amplitude and frequency, that is 'chattering'.
 The chattering problem is caused by two primary reasons, fast dynamics
 and the use of digital controllers with finite sampling time.Chattering
 is a harmful phenomenon because it leads to low control accuracy, high
 wear of moving mechanical parts, and high heat losses in power circuits.
 Therefore, the cattering problem is an majoy obstacle for SMCs implementation.
 To deal with those negative effects on SMCs, the researchers of SMCs have
 developed some new techniques.
 Taking %%[Robust adaptive nonsingular fast terminal sliding-mode tracking
 control for an uncertain quadrotor UAV subjected to disturbances] for example,
 this new type of SMC maintains the advantages including high precision
 tracking performances and good robustness against various external disturbances.
 Furthermore, it has solved the chattering problem.
 Though the simulation has been conducted, the experiment haven't yet.

Contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research has developed the UKF model to estimate the motors efficicency
 of a multirotor and the cooperative transportation system.
 The estimated motors efficiency feedbacks to the new designed controller
 based on geometric tracking controller.
 The controller can endure the disturbance caused by the defective motors
 and the feedback motors efficiency.
 Though the defective motors lead to more translational and rotational error,
 the feedback estimated motors efficiency significantly reduce the error
 during flight.
 That is to say the performance of the flight is improved when the motors
 of the multirotor is defective.
