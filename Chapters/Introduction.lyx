A multirotor has four rotors is a underactuated mechanical system (UMS).
 It has six degrees of freedom (DOF) to be controlled, but has only four
 motors to exert force and torque on itself.
 Contrast to a fixed-wing aircraft

, a multirotor doesn't need a runway to take off.
 It's a vertical take-off-and-landing unmanned aerial vehicle which has
 several potential like portability, agility and mobility.
 The advantages of a multirotor have resulted in various applications including

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of seniors in the lab did the research about Parameter Estimation and
 Control of Multirotors Using Integral Concurrent Learning.
 The research estimates mass and moment of inertia of a multirotor, and
 feedbacks the estimation parameter for better flight control.
 The research experiment shows the validity of the theory when the battery
 is fully charged.
 However, when the battery voltage is getting lower, the estimated mass
 in the experiment is getting bigger .This is because the low voltage battery
 doesn't have enough voltage to actuate the motors and other elements on
 multirotor.
 The situation is reasonable because my senior doesn't put the battery power
 model in his reseach.
 As mentioned above, the unmodeled hardware effect does influence the research,
 and I was curious that if I could do qualitative and quantitative analysis
 to not ideal hardware effect.
 Eventually, I select motors on a multirotor as my research subject.

Estimate Motors Efficiency of the Multirotor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The present work has developed the UKF model which is able to estimate the
 motors efficiency during multirotor flight, and the estimation method is
 classified into model predict estimation.
 There are two principal reasons to show this application is important.
 First, the motors efficiency estimation of the multirotor gives the researchers
 more detail information of the fault motors.
 According to the information, the researchers could estimate the flight
 limit of the multirotor with fault motors, and replan the flight misson
 to a simple one.
 Second, discovering the level of the motors damage prevents researchers
 from confusing some research problem is contributed by a new algorithm
 or new technique, because there is a chance that the problem is simply
 caused by the defective motors.
 Many researches have developed on the scenarios like controlling or detecting
 a multirotor with a broken motor

 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, to estimate the efficiency of all motors on a quadrotor, the author first
 builds the dynamics of multirotor with fault and discretizes the linear
 control system.
 Then, the author designs the states vector and measurements of the motors
 efficiency estimator and proves the stability of the estimator with Lyapunov
 analysis and theory.
 Although the estimation of the motors efficiency roughly matches the ground
 truth value, it still has about 15% estimation error.
 In addition, the estimator in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is linear, which means the research has linearized the highly nonlinear
 system.
 On the other hand, the present work designs the UKF model which is suitable
 for nonlinear system to estimate the motors efficiency.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fault tolerant control (FTC)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prime objective of the FTC is to maintain the controller stability when
 the system undergoes failures such as hardware broken, wind disturbance
 and uncertainty.
 The studies of FTCs have developed for more than 30 years, and there were
 numerous researchers put their effort into them.
 A FTC is often divided into two categories: passive FTCs and active FTCs.
 The passive FTCs are featured in their robust control characteristic.
 A fault in passive FTCs is usually treated as disturbance or a model uncertaint
y.
 The stability in those FTCs is mostly guaranteed by Lyapunov analysis and
 theory.
 There were many developed passive FTCs such as sliding mode control (SMC),
 Hâˆž control

 and adaptive control.
 On the other hand, the active FTCs include a variety of methods in order
 to conquer the system failures, such as fault detection and diagnosis (FDD)

 and trajectory replanning

.
 With those positive aforementioned methods, the active FTCs usually defeat
 the passive FTCs on most flight performance in the specific scenario.
 However, active FTCs can only deal with the certain problem, and have little
 tolerance on other failures.
 On this perspective, passive FTCs usually defeat active FTCs in extensive
 fault tolerance.
 The principal control objectives in the present work mostly matches with

 In the research active FTC 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the author adopts a cascaded proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control,
 and defines the motors fault variable in control input.
 After the estimator detects the motors fault, the FTC provides control
 reconfiguration, and sacrifices heading angle command.
 In contrast, the present work adopts nonlinear control method with stability
 analysis to deal with the highly nonlinear multirotor dynamics, and the
 yaw angle is controlled despite the motors fault.
 In addition to the active FTCs, there are numerous intelligent passive
 FTCs are based on sliding mode control (SMC)

, and they are developed to solve the uncertainties, unmodeled variables
 and disturbances.
 The SMCs have high compatibility so that they are capable to be compatible
 with other techniques including adaptive control and backstepping control.
 The aforementioned SMC researches demonstrate the trajectory tracking performan
ce and robustness under disturbances via simulation, which ensure the effectiven
ess of resisting disturbances and the flight performance is great.
 Besides, the stability analysis of the SMCs are rigorously proved according
 to the Lyapunov analysis and theory.
 However, they experience the unfavorable problem of oscillations with finite
 amplitude and frequency, that is 'chattering'.
 The chattering problem is caused by two primary reasons, fast dynamics
 and the use of digital controllers with finite sampling time.
 Chattering is a harmful phenomenon because it leads to low control accuracy,
 high wear of moving mechanical parts and high heat losses in power circuits.
 Therefore, the chattering problem is an major obstacle for SMCs implementation.
 To deal with those negative effects on SMCs, the researchers of SMCs have
 developed some new techniques.
 Taking

 for example, this new type of SMC maintains the advantages including high
 precision tracking performances and good robustness against various external
 disturbances.
 Furthermore, it has solved the chattering problem.
 Though the simulation has been conducted, the experiment haven't yet.
 On the other hand, the present work doesn't have the chattering problem,
 which can be confirmed by Fig.

Contributions

\begin_layout Standard
This research has developed the UKF model to estimate the motors efficiency
 of a multirotor and the cooperative transportation system.
 The new designed controller based on geometric tracking controller can
 endure the disturbance caused by the defective motors and the error of
 feedback motors efficiency.
 Though the defective motors lead to more translational and rotational error,
 the feedback estimated motors efficiency significantly reduce the error
 during flight.
 That is to say the performance of the flight is improved when the motors
 of the multirotor is defective.
